# Icons information

Some icons have been found on https://www.iconfinder.com/ and downloaded as SVG.

All SVG tree item icons were edited online with [https://editor.method.ac/](https://editor.method.ac/)

Tree item icons are 16x16 resolution, in the online editor don't forget to set canvas width and height to this resolution.

To obtain the PNG version, from the online editor, simply click «File -> Export as PNG».

Once under Visual Studio, don't forget to set the PNG «Build Action» as «Resource» so that is can be referenced from a XAML file.
